Introduction
************
This repository contains code to replicate the main structural estimates in the following paper:

- Ned Augenblick and Matthew Rabin, 2019, "An Experiment on Time Preference and Misprediction in Unpleasant Tasks", *Review of Economic Studies*, 86(3): 941-975

This project uses a modified version of Pozzis & Nunnaris code from their replication of Augenblick&Rabin (2018).
